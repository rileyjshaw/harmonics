# Harmonics

**CAUTION: Sometimes flashes.**

This project stacks a bunch of randomly selected trigonometric functions in a shader. You can [try it out online here](https://rileyjshaw.com/harmonics).

This is a quick project I made to test my [ShaderPad](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/shaderpad) library. It's not precious, so please [add pull requests](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/harmonics/pulls) if you have ideas! Iâ€™ll merge changes quickly as long as the app remains reasonably performant and the visual output looks good.
